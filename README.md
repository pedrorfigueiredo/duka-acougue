## Introduction

Demo: [Só Carnes Silva](https://seu-cantinho.web.app/)

"Só Carnes Silva" is an e-commerce app for a Butcher Shop. 

It is a SPA (Single Page Application) served by a RESTful API, using the MERN stack: MongoDB + Express + React + Node.js.

This is the front-end side, made in React.

You'll need to install and run both the front-end and back-end (using npm or yarn) for making it work properly.

Back-end: [Link](https://github.com/pedrorfigueiredo/so-carnes-silva-back-end)

## Install

```sh
npm install
```

## Running

```sh
npm start
```

Now your "Só Carnes Silva" Front-end is running at http://localhost:3000
